The learning outcomes of this project included:
  Recreating many of the existing Three.js controls, including orbit camera controls, using only low-level functions and resources
  Using appropriate mathematical operations to manipulate 3D objects
  Testing and documenting a graphics interaction system
  Develop code capable of interacting with JavaScript events (key presses, mouse clicks/position etc.)

Demo:

  Please note that it takes some time to load all the 3D Objects and Models used
  
Controls:
  Press [H] to display the help text
  Rotate Cube/Model using [1], [2], [3] (-x, -y, -z axis) [Req 3]
  Change Render Mode using [E], [V], [F] (for Edges, Vertices, Face) [Req 4]
  Move the Camera using [W], [A], [S], [D] and the up/down arrow keys [Req 5]
  Use the mouse buttons and scroll wheel to orbit the camera about any arbitrary point [Req 6]
  Click [R] to reset the Camera and [0] to reset the Cube/Model's rotation
  Toggle between the Cube/Model Modes by clicking [M] [Req 8 and 9]
  Hold [N] to show the Cube's outline and the Model inside it [Req 8 and 9]
  Toggle between Day/Night Modes by clicking [L] [Req 10]
